# Doing presentaitons


- Talk about what you do well and how you did it. Don't talk about what things/features you didn't do but wanted to... but can say this is what your plans are for the next version. Don't self depricate yourself, but rather explain things you noticed and what improvements you can make.
- Explain code you haven't written yourself


### Making it fun

- Using analogies
- Fun expression: "shaving the yak" - analogy that you get rid of one error just to get another error to fix.
