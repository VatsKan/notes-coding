-- variable names can start with underscore or with a-z A-Z, or theoretically any unicode character
-- key words (cannot be used as variable names):
False	await	else	import	pass
None	break	except	in	raise
True	class	finally	is	return
and	continue	for	lambda	try
as	def	from	nonlocal	while
assert	del	global	not	with
async	elif	if	or	yield
